Minimalist Media Player
=====================

A simple but effective media player built around the Windows Media Player ActiveX control.

It provides both a minimalist/keyboard-operated user interface (so that on-screen controls don't detract from the video) and the controls to view the video in a minimalist window with no borders, window title bar/caption, progress bar, video timestamps, etc, and with the window resized to fit the video perfectly, eliminating ugly black borders/bands around the video, particularly above and below. This provides an immersive viewing experience even when not played full-screen.
